                <h3>Why Following Building Plans is Important</h3>
                <p><strong>Date:</strong> December 04, 2025</p>
                <p>During my internships I learned that even small mistakes on site can cause big problems later. Always following the approved plans and drawings helps keep the building safe and saves time and money.</p>
